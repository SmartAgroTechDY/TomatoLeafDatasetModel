Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset and Detection Code
Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for the detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases. The dataset is divided into several categories, each representing a different type of disease affecting tomato leaves. This project is part of my final year project, focusing on the development of machine learning models for accurate and automated disease detection in tomato crops.

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of images of tomato leaves, organized into the following categories:

Tomato_healthy: Healthy tomato leaves without any signs of disease.
Bacterial_spot: Leaves affected by bacterial spot disease.
Early_blight: Leaves showing symptoms of early blight.
Late_blight: Leaves with signs of late blight.
Leaf_Mold: Tomato leaves affected by leaf mold.
Septoria_leaf_spot: Leaves showing septoria leaf spot disease.
Spider_mites_Two-spotted_spider_mite: Leaves infested with two-spotted spider mites.
Tomato_mosaic_virus: Leaves infected with tomato mosaic virus.
Target_Spot: Leaves showing target spot disease.
Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus: Leaves affected by tomato yellow leaf curl virus.
The dataset is intended for training and evaluating machine learning models aimed at identifying and classifying these diseases.
